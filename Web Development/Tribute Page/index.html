            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Sheldon Cooper was born and raised in Galveston, Texas, USA. From a young age, he showed signs of exceptional intelligence and an insatiable curiosity about the world around him. His parents, Mary and George Cooper, recognized his potential and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, often buying him books and educational toys to stimulate his mind.

                By the time he was three years old, Sheldon had taught himself to read and was already working on advanced mathematics problems. His parents quickly realized that their son was not like other children and decided to homeschool him. This decision proved to be the right one as Sheldon excelled in his studies, completing his high school education at the age of 11.
                
                Sheldon's parents were determined to give their son the best possible education and sent him to college at the age of 12. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned his first Ph.D. in theoretical physics at the age of 16. Despite his young age, Sheldon's work was groundbreaking and caught the attention of many in the scientific community.
                
                Sheldon's early life was not without challenges. He struggled with social interactions and had difficulty making friends. His intense focus on his studies made it difficult for him to relate to others his age. However, he found solace in the world of science, where his intellect and unique perspective were appreciated.
                
                Overall, Sheldon's early life was marked by his exceptional intellect and the support of his parents, who recognized his potential and helped him achieve his goals.</p>
